<div class="detail1"><h1>Synopsis</h1><p>Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's mind, where they help advise her through everyday life.</p></div>
<div class="detail2"><h1>Characters</h1><p>Joy is smart, boisterous, hyperactive, exuberant, outgoing, and fiercely optimistic. The smallest spark of positivity makes her burst with excitement. She always sees the good in everything, which, on the flip side, causes her to be somewhat oblivious to the other, sad aspect of things. She is not insensitive to negative emotions; for instance, the destruction of Riley's Islands of Personality does bring sorrow to her; but her positive nature leads her to quickly push those feelings aside, refrain from being sad or angry, and think positive instead. Since on the contrary, Sadness is compelled to see the negative aspect of things, the two have completely different outlooks on the events of Riley's life.</p><br><br><br><p>Sadness and Joy are polar opposites. While Joy is outgoing and ferociously optimistic, Sadness is slow and more prone to lie on the ground. Though joyful events can get her to smile (such as when Riley scores her first goal), she is usually pessimistic and consistently sees the negative side of things.</p></div>
 <div class="detail2"><h1>Production</h1><p>As a child, director Pete Docter relocated with his family to Denmark when his father moved to study the music of Carl Nielsen.[15] While his sisters had an easy time adjusting to the new surroundings, Docter felt he was judged constantly by peers.[16] While other kids were interested in sports, Docter sat alone drawing, a hobby that eventually led him to animation.[17] His social anxiety ended by high school.Thus,he writes the story.</p></div>
