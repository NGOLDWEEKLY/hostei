<div class="detail1"><h1>Synopsis</h1><p>Everyone’s favorite family of superheroes is back in “Incredibles 2” – but this time Helen is in the spotlight, leaving Bob at home with Violet and Dash to navigate the day-to-day heroics of “normal” life. It’s a tough transistion for everyone, made tougher by the fact that the family is still unaware of baby Jack-Jack’s emerging superpowers. When a new villain hatches a brilliant and dangerous plot, the family and Frozone must find a way to work together again—which is easier said than done, even when they’re all Incredible.</p></div>
<div class="detail2"><h1>Characters</h1><p>Mr. Parr is a Superman analogue. He possesses superhuman strength, near invulnerability and even an ability similar to Peter Parker’s Spidey Sense, called Danger Sense. In Incredibles 2, Bob has become a stay-at-home dad so that his wife Helen can once again fight crime and sway public opinion back in favor of Supers.</p><br><p>Helen’s main power is being a super mom, but her special capability is being able stretch her body like Mr. Fantastic from the Fantastic Four.In the new film, Elastigirl has been asked to come out of retirement to help change the public perception about Supers. </p><br><p>Dash is Bob and Helen’s 10-year-old son. His power is super speed, much like the Flash or Quicksilver. He is overconfident and full of energy.  In the initial movie, he doesn’t understand why he and his family have to keep their powers secret and sees it as unfair that he can’t compete in sports at school. It doesn’t look like much has changed in Incredibles 2.</p><br><p>Violet is the eldest Parr child. Her powers include invisibility and force field projection, similar to Invisible Woman’s power set from Fantastic Four. In the new film, she is going through puberty while having to help her dad take care of the household.</p><br><p> Jack-Jack is the baby of the family, he may be the most powerful Super ever.  In Incredibles 2, he has been shown to have powers like laser vision, teleportation, shapeshifting (into a gremlin-like creature), electrokinesis and self-combustion like the Human Torch.</p></div>
 <div class="detail2"><h1>Production</h1><p>Following The Incredibles, Brad Bird directed his next film for Pixar, Ratatouille, which was released in June 2007. Near its premiere, Bird said he was open to an idea of a sequel to The Incredibles, but only if it could be better than the original. He stated, "I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together." In a May 2013 interview, Bird reiterated his interest in a sequel: "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have—because I love those characters, and love that world ... I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, and if I can get them to click all together, I would probably wanna do that." </p></div>
